# CLI Team Builder 

This is a command-line application designed to help managers easily input their own information as well as information about their employees. The application will prompt the user for basic details such as name, ID, and email for each team member. For specific job roles such as Manager, Engineer, and Intern, additional information such as office number, GitHub profile, and education will be required. Once all team members have been added, the application will automatically generate an HTML page displaying all the relevant information provided. This way, managers can quickly and easily access all their employees's important information in one convenient location.
